# Purs


## Features

- [ ] Add more info about the PRs
  - [ ] Number of Approvals
- Write each run command
- Only show info on reviews and comments if they exist. That makes it easier to find.
- Tabulate the output

## Design

- The title line should be of the form:

- Title
- Tag for repo name. Eg. (weaver-test)
- Tag for whether it's a whale (> 10 updates)
- Tag for Draft
- Tag for Activity (fire if there are multiple reviewers)
- Tag if its approved

These can take precedence; Eg. if a PR is approved we don't care about Activity for instance.
